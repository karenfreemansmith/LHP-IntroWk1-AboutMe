        <p class="lead">I'm a truck driver from Oregon. I have been driving a truck since 1992.  My first time driving a semi was with my <em>(now ex-)</em> husband. He was a truck driver, but not making enough money to keep the rent paid. So when we got evicted, my daughter and I ended up "riding" on the truck with him. And he figured as long as I was there, I should drive it too. </p>
        <p>I eventually went to school and got a CDL and started getting paid for the work I was doing. The paychecks were addictive and I spent about 6 years driving while my parents raised my daughter.</p>
        <p>I spent most of those 6 years trying to find a job that would allow me to get off the road and have a real life <em>(while paying my bills - that was always the deal breaker!)</em>. I finally managed to make the transition from trucker to IT worker in 1998 with a job in tech support.</p>
        <p>I went to school, got a certification from Microsoft, and eventually worked my way into a lead programmer position with Lockheed Martin. I also got remarried and had another child.</P>
        <p>When my son was 3, the taught himself to read. <em>(Maybe, I don't know exactly how it happened, but one day he just started reading to me.)</em> It was not too long after that I decided he needed to be homeschooled and turned to trucking again as a way to spend the days with my child and work at the same time.</p>
        <p>We spent about 8 years driving and learning until he could go to school and find interesting things to learn again <em>(which ended up being about 8th grade)</em>. I struggled to find work so I could be home with my son, but programming moved on while I was driving and I never could get past the interview to an actual job. So now I am on the road alone and studying web development, hoping to plug the gaps in my previous training and experience and the state of the industry today.</p>

        <h3>My Computer(s)</h3>
        <p>I got my first computer in 1989. It was an IBM clone with a dual floppy disk drive (no hard drive) and an amber monochrome monitor. These days I have two laptops, one running Ubuntu and a brand new on with Windows 10.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>My Smart Phone</h3>
        <p>I always said I'd never own a cell phone, but know that I have this smart phone I don't know how I could live without one! I love discovering new apps for the phone and hope to be able to program my own apps one day.</p>

        <img src="img/truck.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="my hot wheels truck">
        <h3>My "Hot Wheels" Truck</h3>
        <p>I do like the truck, that's why I decided to buy it instead of do a regular lease. I'll be sorry to see it go if I turn it in early - or when I have to sell it. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>My Kindle</h3>
        <p>I love reading, and this kindle makes it possible to carry my whole library with me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>My Little House in Eugene</h3>
        <p>It's a tiny house in a forgotten neighborhood, but it's quiet and the rent is cheap.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>My Flute</h3>
        <p>I don't play it very much anymore, but it's still one of the things I'd pack first if I was headed out to a deserted island somewhere.</p>

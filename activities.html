    <h2>These are a few of my favorite activities:</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobbies</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>I suppose everyone that loves to read wants to grow up to be a writer. I love the magic of storytelling and being transported to other places and times through the written word. I want to make that magic happen too! I'm still an amateur though, with a drawer full of first chapters and half-finished stories.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
        <p>I always liked art, even as a child. Art supplies were expensive though and I never got very good at drawing and painting. Then I discovered "Painter" and found a never-ending supply of art stuff to play with. I also like photography and use Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, and Inkscape to create my own graphics.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I started programming when I was 10 years old and my dad brough home a Commodore PET. (It had a built in monitor, a tiny keyboard, and a <em>cassette tape drive</em>!) I learned BASIC on this machine and eventually graduated to a TRS-80 where I reprogrammed adventure games so my friends could find items they'd really like. These days my interest has evolved into creating interactive websites like the ones I built and maintain at <a href="http://thepracticetest.com">The Practice Test</a> or <a href="http://aspiringwriters.org">Aspiring Writers</a>.</p>

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>I enjoy reading and have eclectic tastes. I read newspapers, magazines, bathroom walls, classic fiction, bestsellers, and creative non-fiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>One of the best experiences of my life was home schooling my son for 8 years while working as an over-the-road truck driver. Besides that I also enjoyed tutoring other students when I was in school, from 4th grade all the way through college. I've also been involved in training other employees in almost every job I've ever had.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Being Outdoors</h3>
        <p>One of the best things about trucking is it's like being outdoors all the time, except with air conditioning or heat and a lot less bugs. I've always enjoyed various outdoor activities like hiking, camping, rock climbing, and swimming. </p>

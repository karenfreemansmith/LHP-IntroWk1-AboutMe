    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <h2>These are a few of my favorite interests:</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Politics</h3>
        <p>It's election year, and how can you resist all the drama, mud-slinging and plans to make the world a better place?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Religion</h3>
        <p>I am a spectator at the religious sport - not a participant. But I love to learn how other people think and believe. I'm especially interested in comparative religion and love to find the common stories and ideas between religions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Health and Fitness</h3>
        <p>Even though I'm pretty fat, I still have an interest in health and fitness - just much less time to do anything about it than when I was younger. I especially like yoga, walking, and dancing. I'm also interested in vegetarian foods.</p>

        <h3>Sociology/Psychology</h3>
